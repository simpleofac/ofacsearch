SimpleOFAC Suite™ Compliance Software consists of the following major components:

#. :ref:`list-index`.

   Manage sanction list. It supports the list upload. The following lists are support, and it can easily add a new plugin 
   to support a new list: 
   BIS-DPL, BIS-UNVENRIFIED, CIA WORLD LEADER, EU, HUD-LDP, NS-PLC, OCC UNAUTHORIZED BANK LIST, OFAC SDN, OFSI ENTITY, 
   OFSI INDIVIDUAL, STATE-DEBAR, and UK-HM.
    
#. :ref:`screening-index`.

   Manage screening engines. Screening engine screens text/message against the sanction list and gives alerts or no alert result.
   
#. :ref:`case-index`.

   The alert result can be loaded into case management for review. It has build-in algorithm to detect duplicated text/message.
   
#. Custom Reporting and auditing

#. Build-in configurable workflow

#. User/group/role/permission/Organization Unit Administration

#. Analysis tools
   
   * Free Text Lookup:  It is a very useful browse-based tool used to screen any text or message using the screening engine service. 
   * SimpleOFAC Client: It is a Java utility and runs on the user’s desktop. It takes a customer file as input and screens the files
     against screening engine service, generates statistics, such as number of alerts, hits, their match term, and number of hits 
     each sanction list entry receives. 
    
   Both of them can be used as a test tool to test screening engine service and the sanction lists. Thus help users to do 
   the turning of the sanction list itself (create Exception (good guy), or exclude AKA)
   and/or on the parameter settings on screening engine service (setting threshold, scan mode, etc.).

The :ref:`glossary` is common terms used in this document , which is also worth going through.
