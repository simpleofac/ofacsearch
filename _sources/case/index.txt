Case Management
============================================


Watch list alert and/or AML alert can be loaded into the case management for review. 
It has a configurable workflow, build-in document support, email notification, and audit log.

.. note:: 

   All the data in the case management are assigned to an Organization Unit. Users are authorized by combining the Organization
   Unit code with permission and roles. Users may be able to have full access to alerts in Organization Unit A, but have no access 
   or limited access to the alerts in Organization Unit B. (Please see User security section :ref:`admin-index` for details).
