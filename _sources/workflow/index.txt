Workflow
============================================


Watch list alert and/or AML alert has state or status code; for example, new, pending, under investigation, close (not match), 
close (match), etc. Users can define any status code as needed via Resource->dropdown :ref:`res-dropdown` .

Workflow rules define what actions the current alert can be performed. It defines action code, action name, from status, to status, 
permission key,etc. This is the rules to move alert from one status to another. It can be very simple, from New to False match or 
True Match, or can be a little complicated, like add comments, add documents, escalate to senior investigator, etc. 
It is easily configurable to suit your business needs without vendor involvement.
