<p>SimpleOFAC Suite has a flexible security system which allows you to configure who can access
and what they can do/see within SimpleOFAC. It supports the concepts of users, groups, permissions, roles,
and organization units.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><strong>Users</strong> are the individual members of the organization who are allowed to log in to the SimpleOFAC
to perform their required tasks. Those include investigators, compliance officers, administrators etc.
The administrator controls the levels of functionality and the data that users can access by
assigning them to Groups or by granting roles directly to each user.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> are collections of users. Users that carry out common functions are grouped together in order that
roles (and therefore permissions) can be granted to the group as a whole instead of to each individual user.
This is possible as all members of the group inherit the security permissions that are assigned to users through
group roles. You can add as many users as you want to a particular group.</li>
<li><strong>Permissions</strong> govern access to functions within the system including the menu items and workflow actions.
Permissions provide access to functional areas of SimpleOFAC suite. It combines with Organization Units and
sanction lists’ Origin to govern access to the data.</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong> are collections of one or more permissions. A role determines the functionality a user can access
in the system. The administrator may grant several roles to users or to user groups. An administrator defines
and maintains the security roles within the system and the permissions associated with each role. A role may be
thought of as a job function that one of the users of the system may use. For example, Alert Investigator,
Supervisor, List administrator, and so on. When role is assigned to users or groups, it must also specify an
Organizational Unit. User can have a role in Organization Unit X, while has role B in Organization Unit Y.</li>
<li><strong>Organization Units</strong> are lines of business within the organization. Like sanction lists must be assigned to an Origin,
alert and customers and other entities within the SimpleOFAC must be assigned to a particular Organization Unit.
This enables the data to be split into different business areas that can be acted upon by specific users and groups
of users, who also have roles that are assigned to specific Organization Units.</li>
</ol>
<p>SimpleOFAC suite uses its internal tables for authentication and authorization. It also can integrate with
LDAP for authentication. If internal tables are used for authentication, system administrator can configure
the password strength rules (via regular expression), password expire interval, maximum allowed failed login count, etc.</p>
